A new semester has just started for me

---

Just two days after my research stay concluded, I started a new semester that makes me more than excited. I am finally on my analysis and design of algorithms course as well as finally taking a course on operating systems; two of the courses that interest me the most. These are the courses I'm taking this semester:
#### Fall 2024 Schedule

<ul>
    <li>Operating Systems</li>
    <li>Analysis and Design of Algorithms</li>
    <li>Software Engineering</li>
    <li>Business Development</li>
</ul>

Although the one doesn't interest me very much is the last one, I should not take it for granted and still study for it. All of us know how tech companies shock the world and change the way we do things. Knowing the basics of a business is beneficial for my degree.

As always, I like studying from different books and for my courses but my main books will be the following:

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-fourth-Thomas-Cormen/dp/026204630X">Introduction to Algorithms, 4th Edition by Thomas H. Cormen</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Operating-System-Concepts-Abraham-Silberschatz/dp/1119800366">Operating Systems Concepts, 10th Edition by Abraham Silberschatz</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Software-Engineering-10th-Ian-Sommerville/dp/0133943038">Software Engineering, 10th Edition by Ian Sommerville</a></li>

</ul>
