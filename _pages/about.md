I am a passionate undergraduate student interested in everything related to computing and software. I am an avid Linux user and an Open Source Software advocate. I'm finding interest in the field of artificial intelligence as well as in cloud computing. So far, I've had the chance to work as full-stack developer and I'm looking for internship opportunities for Summer of 2025.

Once I get my degree, I hope to land a full-time position where I can work in a competitive environment and grow professionally.
Lately, I've been reading many posts on this [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/)
